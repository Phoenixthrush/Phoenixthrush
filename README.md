# <samp>About Me<samp/>

<samp>So, I've been interested in coding since 2016. It all started when a friend introduced me to this amazing Matrix-style code in Batch during 5th grade. It was just three lines of code that generated random numbers in bright green, and I was instantly hooked.</samp>

<samp>From there, I delved into learning about Linux and how computers work. I even built my own PC. Then, I got my hands on a Raspberry Pi and began exploring open-source projects like music and NAS servers. I also rented VPS servers to host Tor relays and got involved in server administration.</samp>

<samp>My coding journey led me to Python and web development, thanks to YouTube. Python became my go-to language for algorithms and data analysis. For web development, I rely on Bootstrap to simplify the process. However, for projects that require speed and compilation, I also use C and Rust.</samp>

<samp>I'm passionate about all things tech, especially cybersecurity. Kali Linux is my go-to operating system for penetration testing, equipped with tools like Metasploit and SEToolkit. Every day, I strive to learn something new. Currently, I'm diving into assembly basics and reverse engineering using Ghidra.</samp>

<samp>Despite previously using Gentoo, I'm now an Arch user. I enjoy exploring new technologies and breaking away from proprietary software. I've also gained valuable experience through internships, allowing me to understand the intricacies of the IT field.</samp>

<samp>Oh, and I can't forget to mention that I have two awesome cats at home.</samp>

<samp>Currently, I'm studying practical computer science, focusing on Java Application Development and System Technology, right here in Germany. However, I also have a passion for music and games. I particularly love story-driven games like NieR Automata and Life is Strange, as well as classic titles like Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. Games that involve choices and consequences, such as "Detroit Become Human," really captivate me.</samp>

<samp>As for the future, I'm not entirely sure which path I'll take. It could be software engineering, or perhaps something completely different outside of the tech realm.</samp>

<samp>Who knows, right?<samp>
